        <h1> Breakfast Samosas<br>
		</h1>
        </div>
		<h4>
        <p><i>There are step-by-step photographs that M took while I prepared the pastries to cook which hopefully make things easier. 
		This is also the way, I prefer to cook my samosas, I don't like to deep fry but simply baking them takes away from the texture of the pastry.<br><br>
		So, I do a two-step cooking process where I lightly pan-sear the samosas on each side in a little oil and then bake them till they are cooked.<br><br>
        You can do what I do, prepare these for brunch and/or save the rest and reheat them in the mornings. <br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        filling 
        <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil

<li>1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, fresh or dried</li>

<li>1 cup leek, chopped</li>

<li>2 cups sweet potatoes, diced</li>

<li>4 cups packed spinach leaves, fresh</li>

<li>2 thai green/red chili peppers, thinly sliced</li>

<li>1 1/2 teaspoon kosher sea salt</li>

<li>2 large hardboiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>

<li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala </li>
</ul><br>

1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan on medium-high for about 30-40 seconds.
 As soon as the oil gets hot, add the rosemary and stir for 10 seconds. Stir in the leeks and saut√© for 2 minutes. <br>

2. Add the sweet potatoes and coat them with the oil. Cook for another 5 minutes, until the sweet potatoes are just tender.
 Add the spinach leaves along with the chili and salt, stir and continue to cook until the sweet potatoes are completely cooked.
 This will take about 4-5 minutes. If the spinach releases a large amount of water, continue to cook until the liquid evaporates.
 Fold in the eggs and the garam masala. Remove from stove and keep the filling aside, until ready to use.

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
<li>Dust a clean pastry board or smooth kitchen surface with a little flour. Unwrap the dough and divide the dough into 14 equal parts. Mold each part into a ball, cover the balls with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out while you are preparing the pastries.</li>

<li>Take one ball of dough and roll it out into a 5-6 inch circle, dusting with a little flour to prevent sticking.  The edges of the circle do not need to be perfect as you will fold them over.</li>

<li>Divide the circle into two semicircles with a sharp knife or pastry cutter. Take one semicircle of the pastry in your hand, using your fingers bring the straight ends of the semicircle together and brush the straight edges with a little water and gently press to seal to form a cone. </li>

<li>Fill the cone with a generous tablespoon of the sweet potato filling prepared earlier. </li>

<li>Brush the open ends of the cone with water and then press gently to seal the mouth. Brush this sealed edge with a little water and then fold this edge once over itself to form a tight seal.</li>

<li>Prepare the rest of the samosas similarly and keep aside covered with a damp cloth until ready to cook.</li>
</ol>
