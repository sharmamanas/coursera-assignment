    <h4><p><i>I would like to share some tips and tricks for perfect, fluffy bahtura recipe.
	to get a perfect shape, kneading the dough is very critical. i have kneaded the dough for almost 8-10 minutes continuously.
	also, i have added 1 tbsp of rava while mixing the dough. rava helps to get a crispy bhature after deep frying. lastly,
	i would highly recommend to use sour curd or yogurt. sourness would hasten the fermentation process and the dough would be extra soft.
