        <h1> Khaman Dhokla Recipe</h1>
		</h1>
        </div>
		<h4>
        <p><i>Dhokla is one of the specialities of Gujarati cuisine and is enjoyed as a snack. 
		This is an easy-to-make snack recipe that can be prepared anytime and is best enjoyed 
		with tempered or pan-fried green chillies with a little salt sprinkled over them.
		It’s a quick dish that can be prepared in just 30-minutes and requires ingredients
		that you can easily find in your kitchen cabinet. It’s the most common type of 
		dhokla that you will see anywhere. People confuse Khaman Dhokla with the white-coloured one;
		however, it’s very easy to differentiate between the two just by the colour itself. 
		Khaman Dhokla is generally yellow, while the other dhokla is white. 
		Their main ingredient is also different, as the Khaman Dhokla is prepared 
		using gram flour or besan and the White Dhokla is prepared using rice flour
		and split chickpeas. While Khaman Dhokla is sweet and sour, the other dhokla 
		is a generally sour in taste. Undoubtedly, there are several differences between 
		the two types of dhoklas, but they are part of a culture that loves feeding people.
		Gujarati cuisine is known to have a lot of flavourful and delightful snacks to offer
		and dhokla tops the popularity list. It’s one of the best breakfast options to have as
		its light and fills your stomach easily. Here is an easy way to make Khaman Dhokla, which is soft and spongy and tastes super-delicious.

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ul>
<li>Step 1 Prepare the Dhokla batter and let it ferment for 1-2 hours.
To prepare this delicious Khaman Dhokla recipe, take a glass bowl and 
add gram flour, salt, water, lemon juice and baking soda in it. Mix well
 all these ingredients. Allow the batter to ferment for 1-2 hours. In the
 meantime, pour boiled water in a steamer and grease the utensil with oil.</li>
 <li>Step 2 Cook the batter for 15-20 minutes in the idli/dhokla cooker
Pour the dhokla batter in the utensil and cook on low flame for 15-20 minutes.
 Check with a knife after 15 minutes by inserting it inside the dhokla. If the
 knife comes out clean, remove it from the stove. Allow the dish to cool and then cut into pieces.</li>
 <li>Step 3 Prepare the tempering
For the tempering, heat another pan 
with oil in it over moderate flame.
 Once the oil is sufficiently hot,
 add mustard seeds, curry leaves and 
 vertically sliced green chilli. Add 1/2 cup of water in the pan and allow it to boil.
 On 2-3 boils, squeeze 1/2 lemon, add sugar and green coriander leaves.
 If you are someone who likes it spicy you can add some finely chopped green chillies to the top coating.
 You can also make Dhokla sandwich by layering Dhokla and adding your favourite sauce to it.</li>
 <li>Step 4 Serve the moist Khaman Dhokla with Faafda and Jalebi
Turn off the heat and pour the tempering on the dhokla and sprinkle the coconut powder over the dish.
 Transfer the dish to a serving bowl and serve it with green coriander chutney. Khaman Dhokla is best
 enjoyed when paired with Faafda and Jalebi. Try this delicious snack recipe at home with your family and friends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips :</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beat dhokla batter a couple of times to get air into it. This will make the dhokla fluffy. Do this before adding baking soda or fruit salt.</li>
<li>If the batter becomes frothy, do not whisk it more. It should be of thick consistency.</li>
<li>Always use eno while beating the batter. If you don't have eno at home, you can use baking soda and lemon juice in the batter.</li>
<li>The dhokla is always dry, as the chickpea flour contains a lot of protein content , which when mixed with water makes it dry.</li>
<li>Make sure that the steamer is heated for at least 4-5 minutes before placing the plates filled with batter otherwise it may take more time to cook and the dhokla won't be spongy.</li>
